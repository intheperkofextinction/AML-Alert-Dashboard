# 📊 AML Alert Dashboard  
**Real-Time Monitoring of Suspicious Financial Transactions using Power BI**

> This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to identify and monitor suspicious activities in financial data using real-time analytics and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) indicators.

---

## 📁 Overview

This project features an interactive dashboard built using **Power BI** that processes a large synthetic dataset of financial transactions. The dashboard enables real-time monitoring of potential money laundering activities, providing insights through risk scoring, categorization, and alert generation.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

✅ Risk Level Classification (High / Medium / Low)  
✅ Internal vs External Transaction Detection  
✅ KPI Cards: High-Risk %, External Transactions %, Total Amount Paid  
✅ Heatmap of Transaction Frequencies between Banks  
✅ Time-Series: Amount Paid by Risk Level  
✅ Alerts Table for Investigative Teams

---

## 📊 Visuals Included

- Risk Level Distribution (Donut Chart)  
- Amount Paid vs Risk Level (Bar Chart)  
- Daily Trends (Line Chart)  
- Alerts Table (Sorted by Risk & Value)  
- Matrix Heatmap of transaction frequency
